## About The Project.
#### Description
**Journal app** is a **SPA** where you can create your notes of the day, about whatever you want and upload images as well as **create, edit and delete** all the notes you want, and not only that that this **SPA** has a system of **authentication with google** so that you can use this incredible app as quickly as possible
#### Purpose of this project.
This project has as its direct purpose the learning of **redux** and the domain and management of it, to know and understand conceptually and theoretically about this pattern, to know the new **redux** tools such as [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/ "Redux Toolkit").

As an additional, although as mentioned above, the main objective is to learn about **redux**, they are not the only knowledge that was learned by making this incredible app, since **authentication** and **CRUD (create, read, update, delete)** is made with [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/ "firebase").
#### Built with.
For this project I use  [React](https://es.reactjs.org/"), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/ "Vite"), [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/ "firebase").  and for the layout of styles it was used [MUI](https://mui.com/"), [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/ "SweetAlert2").
